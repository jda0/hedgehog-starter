# HedgeHog Bot (v2.0)
This project contains a variety of helper functions for use with the HedgeHog
Bot produced by the University of Bristol.

## Functionality
- Face drawing

## Requirements
Library dependencies:
- [WeMos ESP_SSD1306 OLEDESP Library](http://educ8s.tv/arduino-esp8266-tutorial-first-look-at-the-wemos-d1-arduino-compatible-esp8266-wifi-board/)

## Installation
Find your Arduino sketchbook folder, and download the library into
`<SKETCH_BOOK_FOLDER>/libraries/hedgehog-bot-v2`

Library dependencies have been included in case they can no longer be found
online, unfortunately the Arduino IDE won't pick them up without them being
moved. To install them you can use symbolic links on Linux or OS X, on Windows
you'll just have to suck it up and move them.
